# Utils Directory

The `utils` directory is designed to house utility functions and helper modules that can be reused across the application. These functions are typically stateless and focus on performing specific tasks, such as data formatting, API handling, or other common operations.

## Purpose

- Promote code reusability.
- Keep the codebase organized by separating utility logic from core application logic.
- Simplify maintenance and testing of shared functionality.

## Example Usage

You can import utility functions from this directory into your components or pages:

```javascript
import { formatDate } from "../utils/dateUtils";

const formattedDate = formatDate(new Date());
console.log(formattedDate);
```
