# Actions Directory

The `actions` directory is typically used to store functions or modules that handle specific actions or operations in your application. These actions may include API calls, state management operations, or other reusable logic that interacts with your application's data flow.

- Example use cases:
  - Fetching data from an API.
  - Dispatching actions to a state management library (e.g., Redux).
  - Performing side effects or asynchronous operations.
