- The `lib` directory is typically used to store reusable utility functions,
- helper methods, or shared modules that can be used across the application.
-
- This file (`lib.ts`) can serve as a central place to export these utilities,
- making it easier to manage and import them in other parts of the project.
-
- Example usage:
- - Utility functions for data formatting
- - API request helpers
- - Shared constants or configurations
